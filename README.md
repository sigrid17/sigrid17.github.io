# Covid-19 in Singapore dorms

I created 2 versions of the dashboard. The first version was done using Bokeh. It creates 1 output file called Dashboard_yyyymmdd.html. The bottom graph and the table are not very user friendly. 
The second version was done using plotly. The graphs are better but come in separate files (map, bar chart, area plot and table).
